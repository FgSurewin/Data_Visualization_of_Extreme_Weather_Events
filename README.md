# **Investigating the frequency and impact of extreme weather events in the United States**

## Background

There is no doubt that changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather and climate events would have great impacts on both populations and the natural environment. During the recent decade, several weather extremes resulted in tremendous economic loss and caused large losses of life.

## Purpose

Our goal is to investigate and understand the frequency and impact of extreme weather events in the United States. In addition. In this project, we focus on four events that occur between 1996 and 2020, namely tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. In addition, we will develop a web application for interactive data visualization through **[Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)**.

## Data

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Storm Events Database, comprising data from 1955 - 2020 is used in this project. The detailed definition and criteria of each event type can be found on _Storm Data_ preparation document available on [NOAA website](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01016005curr.pdf). In this project, we mainly focus on the four events (tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires) occurred between 1996 to 2020.
